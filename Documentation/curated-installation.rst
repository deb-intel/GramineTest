Intel Confidential Compute images
=================================

Intel Confidential Compute images with Gramine are ready-made solutions for popular machine-learning apps such as PyTorch and Redis. Customize your environment through Interactive scripts. The result is a curated, confidentially-protected Gramine image that includes your specific machine-learning application, common dependencies, and a manifest file that specifies security policies to enforce for your workload.

Note that these confidential Compute images only run on machines that support Intel SGX.
